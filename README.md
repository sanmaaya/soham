# Soham Healing Centre Website

## Project Description

This is the official website for the Soham Healing Centre, a dedicated platform for promoting the practice of **Pranic Healing**. The website is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for individuals interested in learning about and registering for our services.

The primary goal of this site is to inform visitors about the profound benefits of Pranic Healing and encourage them to connect with our center by providing their details through a simple registration form.

## Key Features

* **Registration Portal:** A streamlined registration form allows users to easily submit their details, including their name, age, gender, email, phone number, and location.
* **Automated Data Collection:** Upon submission, user data is securely captured and sent to the client via email for immediate follow-up.
* **Database Integration:** All user information is also stored in a dedicated database, providing a structured and accessible record for the client's use.

## Technologies Used

This website was built as a static site, leveraging the following core technologies:

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* **Backend & Database:** A custom-built backend system (integrated via the AI website builder) for data handling and email notifications.
